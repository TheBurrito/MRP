BUILDING THE PROJECT

It is recommended to build the project out of source, either by making a build
directory within the source tree, or as a sibling of the source tree:

cd <src-path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make


GENERATING DOCUMENTATION

If the system being built on has Doxygen installed, the CMake will also create
a doc target for make that will generate documentation on the entire source in
HTML format. Once cmake has been run, simply type:

make doc

This will produce the documentation and put it in a doc directory in the build
directory. If building is done in-source this will be <src-path>/doc

The documentation at the time of project submission is also available at:
http://cs.rit.edu/~dab5267/mrp


RUNNING THE PROJECT

**Note: There is a bash script called navigator that makes the Map File
  parameter optional and assumes gccis3.map if the map file is left unspecified.

Building the project creates an executable named navigate which can be run from
the command line as follows:

navigate [host] [port] <Waypoints File> <Map File>

Host - (Optional) If specified, signifies the IP or hostname of the computer
  running the Player server to connect to. If not specified, defaults to
  localhost.
  
Port - (Optional) If specified, signifies the port number to connect to the
  Player server with. If not specified, defaults to 6665.
  
Waypoints File - (Required) A file containing x y pairs as navigation goals. These are
  assumed to agree with the coordinate system of the map specified.
  
Map File - (Required) The map file specifies the png file containing the map data along
  with the resolution and coordinate system of the map.
